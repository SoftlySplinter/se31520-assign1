\section{Server Architecture}
\label{sec:server}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having worked in a Level 3 Service team, my attitude toward changing existing code is not
to do so unless it is completely necessary and at that, to modify the code as little as
possible.

The first change I made was to make a simple addition to the UserController which would
echo the username of the currently logged-in user. This allowed me to
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item confirm the user has been logged-in;
\item check if the user is an administrator (currently this is defined by the username
being equal to ``admin'').
\end{inparaenum}

This change involved adding a single method (and associated \verb$GET$ route) which only rendered
JSON (i.e. it would only accept content-type JSON).

The only other change I made to add functionality to include the details of a user's
image in the JSON file from the \verb$GET$ request to \verb$/user/:id.json$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:server-uml-class} shows the overall class diagram for the CSA Server.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.95\textheight, angle=90]{img/server-uml-class.png}
\caption{Class diagram for the CSA server}
\label{fig:server-uml-class}
\end{figure}

As is apparent from figure~\ref{fig:server-uml-class}, the architecture of the server
hasn't changed at all. The only additions are those mentioned above (the addition of a
single \verb$GET$ route, and some additional information in the User's JSON file). Other
than this I felt no real need to change the architecture of the server, nor the way in
which it performs the current functionality.

I did have to fix some small pieces of code in the way emails were produced and sent to
make that code actually work. This was part of fixing the tests on the CSA server.

\section{Client Architecture}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the client doesn't need to do a lot I decided to keep it fairly simple. I still tried
to follow the Model, View, Controller (MVC) design pattern as best as I could. Separating
out a lot of the REST interaction into a sole class.

This also means it would be relatively easy to swap out this method of interaction 
without too much effort.

The views take up the majority of the class diagram as there are different ways of 
presenting the same information. However even these have been kept as simple as possible.

Figure~\ref{fig:client-uml-class} shows the UML Class diagram for the client.

\begin{figure}[h]
%\includegraphics{img/client-uml-class.png} TODO
\caption{UML Class diagram for the client}
\label{fig:client-uml-class}
\end{figure}

From this I then started to consider the choice of language. Ruby was the obvious choice
to keep a bit of compatibility between client and server. I also found that Rails has a
gem which provides client-based REST access to a Rails application; ActiveResource. This
saved me a lot of time and effort during implementation, not having to work out the 
exact, correct, REST requests and the form the JSON files passed between the two take.

Ruby also has some nice graphics libraries, FXRuby is one which is cross-platform, with a
lot of good documentation, based on the FOX toolkit for C++.

\clearpage
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Test Strategy}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first part of the strategy was to fix all the failing tests on the CSA server; the 
most of these were caused by there not being a logged-in user when performing the 
actions. It was a simple matter of creating an entry in the \verb$user_details$ table in
the test fixtures. I then got this entry and added it to a fake session Rails testing
provides to assist with this scenario.\cite{buren07}

With this the majority of the failing tests then passed. The only other broken tests
concerned emailing out broadcasts. This was caused by a problem with the code to do this,
as mentioned in the \nameref{sec:server}~section.

With this complete I then turned my attention to testing the CSA client. However, when
I started to work out what needed testing I found out there was very little. It seemed
pointless to test the ActiveResource models in the client as they were provided by an
external API which should be well tested. The only thing I could test is that the methods
for logging-in and checking administrator users to make sure the GUI only enables the
correct options.

The final step was to look back at the server. As all the client does is poll the server
for information using ActiveResrouce it stands to reason that if the server is correctly
tested, the client should work correctly with it. Of course in real life it's never quite
that simple, but just running and using the client should be enough to verify that it's
working correctly.
